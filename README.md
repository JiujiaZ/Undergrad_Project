## 1. Project Introduction

With the advancement in computation, mathematical modelling and simulation has became an indespensible tool in understanding complicated biological process. However, an *in silico* model without calibration does not have explanatory or prediction power for the phenomenum that we are modelling. Therefore, **parameter estimation** is a crucial step in order to build a physically meaningful model.

In this project, I reported the chanllenges of parameter estimation in computational immunology, where the amount experimental data are limited. I have also illustrated classical parameter estimation techniques **"Genetic Algorithm"** and **"Gauss-Newton iteration"** are not compatible with an state-of-the-art *in silico* model that models respritory infection mechanism.
