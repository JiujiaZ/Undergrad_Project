## 1. Project Introduction

With the advancement in computation, mathematical modelling and simulation have become an indespensible tool in understanding complicated biological process. However, an *in silico* model without careful calibration does not have explanatory or predictive power for the phenomenon that we are modelling. Therefore, **parameter estimation** is a crucial step in order to build a physically meaningful model.

In this project, I reported the challenges of parameter estimation in computational immunology, where the amount experimental data is limited. I have also illustrated that classical parameter estimation techniques **"Genetic Algorithm"** and **"Gauss-Newton iteration"** are not compatible with a state-of-the-art *in silico* model which represents the innate immune response under respritory infection.
